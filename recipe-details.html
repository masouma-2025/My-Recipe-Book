            Sushi is an essential part of Japanese dishes and comes in many varieties. 
            Different areas of Japan offer their own take on this popular dish, based on the availability and variety of regional ingredients.
            We will make it according the reicpe one of our friend <a href="https://www.google.com">Aiko fujimoto</a> from Japan. You can eat this alone or roll into your favorite sushi roll with ingredients of choice.
             I use strips of carrots, cucumbers and slices of avocado. You can adjust the amount of vinegar in this recipe to suit your taste.
             dive into cooking it.

        <p>You can make sushi rice on the stove, in a rice cooker, or even in an Instant Pot.
             Our stovetop method is as easy as it gets. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li><b>Cook the Rice:</b> Add the rinsed rice to a saucepan with water (use 3 parts water to 2 parts rice). Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook, covered, until the rice is tender and all the water has been absorbed.</li>
            <li><b>Cook the Vinegar Mixture:</b> Combine the rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a separate saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li><b>Season the Rice:</b>Allow the vinegar mixture to cool, then stir it into the cooked rice. Stir until the rice is nice and sticky — it'll look wet at first, but it'll dry as it cools.</li>
         </ol>

            Lagman is a hearty soup full of different nutritious vegetables, served with noodles and aromatic broth. It is one of the traditional dishes of Uzbekistan but also popular in some other central Asian countries like Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan.
             You have probably tried many different  soups, but Lagman is not going to be similar to them. Meat plays an essential role in this delicious food and brings it a unique fragrance you never forget. You may also find it as a watery part of Beshbarmak, another tasty Kazakh meal.
             However, it is considered a separate meal and cooked by many Kazakh and Uzbek households.We will make it according the reicepe one of our friend <a href="https://www.google.com">Dilnoza Tursunova</a> from Uzbekistan. So let’s get to know Uzbek Lagman more.

            A trifle is a classic Southern dessert, especially around the holidays. It's a gorgeous layered dessert that's surprisingly easy to make. This trifle is easy to make with layers of white cake, berries, vanilla pudding, and whipped cream.
             It's delicious and looks so elegant layered in a trifle bowl or individual dessert glasses. I got this recipe from my friend from England,<a href="https://google.com">Gill.</a>
